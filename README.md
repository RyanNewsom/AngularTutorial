# AngularTutorial
This is the first section of a Udemy class I am taking on Angular. https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/
I have built a simple Angular application before following the Tour of Hero's guide and reading the docs on Angular's website. However, I wanted a deeper understanding as I plan on mastering one web framework. Angular is my favorite so far, out of Ruby, .Net, and plain on JS. It reminds me a lot of the Android architecture and I think that it is the future.
